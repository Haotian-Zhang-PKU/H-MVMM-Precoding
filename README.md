# Dependencies:
1) Python 3.9.7 

2) Pytorch 1.10.2

3) NVIDIA GPU with a compatible CUDA toolkit (see [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)).

4) Dataset, which can be downloaded at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nLvDrdR-5Q8dFNYYKAl2gA with extraction code u2hn.


# Running the code:

1) Ensure that you have the dataset required for LE-CLN.

2) Set the paths of the training and testing datasets in the script "LE_CLN.py".

3) Run LE_CLN.py to get the channel estimation results of LE-CLN. The code first performs LE-CLN training and then obtains inference results.

# Dataset Introduction:
The data interface has been written in LE_CLN.py. You only need to select the corresponding .pth file in the Dataset based on the system configuration (SNR and pilot number), and replace the file path in the code with your own path.

It is noted that there may be some differences in the results of different training processes.
